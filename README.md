# Perlin-Noise
Perlin Noise example visualizations using MatPlotLib 3D. I created these for an extension IT assignment in late 2021.

Run '3d-Perlin.py' to see 2D Perlin Noise projected on a 3D plane, and 3D Perlin in the form of a sphere. To additionally generate an animation (GIF) of the Perlin sphere, uncomment the 'animatedPerlinSphere()' line, and re-run the file - it will be saved as 'ball.gif' in the current directory. Note that this function will save each frame of the animation as a png in the current directory. This GIF has also been uploaded to the repository
